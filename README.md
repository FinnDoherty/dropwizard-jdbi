# Dropwizard jOOQ

Based on the Dropwizard JDBI project at git@github.com:stevenalexander/dropwizard-jdbi.git

I wanted to look into how to configure a Dropwizard project to use jOOQ.

I also wanted to compare JDBI and jOOQ to demonstrate with specific examples
how jOOQ can simplify development and reduce repetition.


## Setup H2 DB

Creates an H2 DB populated with the migration scripts in src/main/resources/db/migration

```
gradle flywayMigrate -i
```

## Run Dropwizard service

To compile:

```
gradle oneJar
```

To run:

```
java -jar build/libs/dropwizard-jdbi-standalone.jar server config.yml
```

Running the service will start an embedded H2 instance using the person.mv.db file generated by flyway.

To test:

```
gradle test
```
